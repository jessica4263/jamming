# Spotify-myplaylist-app

## Description

This project is a music search application that utilizes the Spotify API to allow users to search for tracks, display albums, and play music. The app enables users to find their favorite songs, play them, and manage their playlists, despite the limitations imposed by Spotifyâ€™s authentication requirements.

**[Live Demo](https://spotify-myplaylist-dev.netlify.app/)**

## Features

- **Search for Tracks**: Find your favorite songs and albums.
- **Play Music**: Listen to previews of tracks directly from the app.
- **Create Playlists**: Add songs to your playlists and save them for later.
- **Custom UI**: Designed with React, JavaScript, and CSS; includes custom assets like backgrounds and player tapes.


## Limitations

Due to Spotify's API requirements, users must log in to their accounts to play full songs. The app utilizes the Spotify iframe player for song playback, which means that the custom player controls cannot be integrated into the app's UI.
